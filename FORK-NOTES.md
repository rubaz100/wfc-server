# mkwfc fork notes

This is the **mkwfc** fork of [WiiLink24/wfc-server](https://github.com/WiiLink24/wfc-server),
pinned at upstream commit `f0825bf` and tracked on branch **`mkwfc`**. The `upstream` remote
points at WiiLink24. Rebase onto upstream with `scripts/rebase-upstream.sh`.

## How we diverge from upstream

1. **Database: PostgreSQL → SQLite.** The `database/` package was ported from `pgxpool`
   (pgx/v4) to `database/sql` + `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no cgo). This removes the
   Postgres install dependency so the server can ship as one self-contained binary.
   - `connection.go` opens a SQLite file and exposes a thin `pool` shim that keeps the
     `QueryRow/Query/Exec(ctx, …)` call shape used across the package.
   - Schema lives in `database/migrations/` (embedded, applied on startup), translated from
     the original Postgres `schema.sql` (kept as `schema.postgres.sql` for reference).
   - `ng_device_id bigint[]` became the junction table `user_ng_device_ids`; the Postgres
     array operators (`&&`, `unnest`) in the ban-overlap queries were rewritten as `EXISTS`
     sub-selects.
   - SAKE `fields jsonb` became `TEXT` (SQLite JSON1); the `||` merge became `json_patch`.

2. **Importable server entrypoint.** The process dispatch in `main.go` was moved into the
   importable package `server` (`server.Run`), so a `mkwfc` wrapper binary can call it.
   `main.go` is now a thin shim calling `server.Run`. This does not yet remove the
   frontend/backend subprocess or RPC listeners; the normal runtime still has two processes.

Pre-existing local additions (admin API, bans/motd endpoints, config-write) were already in
the working tree when this fork branch was created and are carried along unchanged.
